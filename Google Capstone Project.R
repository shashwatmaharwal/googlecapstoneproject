## Introduction
#Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study,
#I performed many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for a fictional company, Cyclistic.

## Scenario

#Cyclistic, is a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 
#Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, 
#so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
